# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Lindsey Sewell

I decided to take this class because as a media artist, an understanding of web development is crucial to become marketable after college. I want to do graphic design, animation and illustration, so it would be very useful to create my own website. I could also potentially find a career in web design.

Some things I found interesting about the internet:

- Quite a few people think that Bill Gates controls the internet.
- It was invented in the early 1970's.
- It was meant to be a "communication system that actually survived".
