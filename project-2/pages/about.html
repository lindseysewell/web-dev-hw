   <div id="paragraph1"><p> Hi! My name is Lindsey Sewell and I'm a media arts major with a focus on digital art and animation. I chose to do an animation for this project because
     I thought it would blend some of my skills and interests into one project. I love animation, but I've never tried claymation before. This particular animation was made for intro to animation class.
     So far, I think it's pretty fun and I thought I would share my experiences for this project. Eventually, I will have a professional website for my animations and illustrations.
   </p></div>
   <div id="paragraph2"> <p> My interest in animation started when I was a child, but I never really explored claymation much due to the fact that it frightened me a bit. Wallace and Gromit was definitely not a favorite of mine. However, working with it was really fun,
     and I was excited to share my process. Making characters is a crucial part of claymation, and that was really fun for me. I hope others reading my tutorial enjoy it as well.

   </p> </div>

   <div id="paragraph3"><p> Claymation is very time consuming, but it's a lot of fun to look at what you've created once you're done.
     I really enjoy watching a simple character with googly eyes come to life. Overall, I hope others try it, even if it's just for fun. For anyone hoping to try,
     the BFA Lab in McGill Hall has a setup with iStopMotion for any Media Arts majors to animate with.
